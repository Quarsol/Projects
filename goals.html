         <h3>23 February, 2018</h3>
         <p class="content">Today I plan on doing a few simple things.<br>1. Finish drill 3 of building simple websites.<br>2. Finish drill 2 of Learn 2 Learn.<br>3. Finish this short term goal drill.<br><br>Reflection:<br><br>It took me a little longer than intended, but I did manage to complete the goals I had set out. I feel like my clearing of the stage made things go by pretty well, as there were less distractions on my screen to pull me away from what I was doing. The break schedule I set for myself also went fairly well I feel. I never sat and stared at the screen too long, and if I felt myself starting to, Id get up and walk around or go stretch or something to get away from the screen for a few minutes.<br><br>As for what didn't go well, I think my ambition was a little too high. I assumed that since I was beginning to get the hang of it and work faster with HTML, and especially CSS, that I could get everything done within a single day. I got most of the way there, but a few unforseen things snagged me for longer than I thought they would have, and thus my 1 day goal turned into more of a 2 day goal. Still managed to get everything done, just not in the time frame I had imagined. I will need to work on that in the future, ensuring that my goals are in a more reasonable time frame for my current skill level. Better to expect it to take more time than less.<br><br>Next time, I will ensure that I measure my competency better before I set a goal that I think is easily achieveable, and proves otherwise. Should never overestimate your ability.</p>

         <p class="content">Goals:<br>1. Resubmit website drill 3.<br>2. Go through Firebase drills.<br>3. Do JavaScript drill 1.<br><br>Reflection:<br><br>Managed to fulfill all of my goals by the end of the day, though just barely. The resubmition of drill 3 took a little longer than I feel it should have, for how easy of a fix the issue was. Firebase was super quick and easy, I was done within 5 minutes with all 3 drills. I spent more time in the queue because I thought there was an error with with download than I did actually completing the drills. JavaScript drill 1 was a down to the wire affair. I managed to finish it just in time before afternoon stand down, though did not get to come back to this file in order to submit my results. I plan on doing a little better as far as time management for my next short term goal drill.<br><br>Things that went well: I feel like going through each of the firebase drills was pretty straight forward. Nothing too complicated or intensive. My resubmission of website 3 was also pretty quick and easy. Just minor tweaks needed.<br><br>Things that didn't go so well: Going through the first JavaScript drill was very intensive. I may have spent a little too much time trying to struggle through it than I should have.</p>

         <p class="content">Goals:<br>1. Complete drill 2 and 3 of JavaScript<br>2. Go to meetup this evening.<br>3. Begin looking over Bucket 1 Project for requirements and formulate basic structure.<br><br>Reflection:<br><br>All goals were met. JavaScript drills 2 and 3 were pretty straight forward after drill 1 the day before. I also looked at what was required for the bucket 1 project and began formulating ideas, as well as getting the basic layout done for each of the pages I will be using. The meetup was rather interesting. Lots of information regarding new stuff with Docker and how it has become vastly supperior to Vagrant when it comes to virtual machines and the memory usage problem when running multiple virtual machines. Overall, a very interesting talk. I think my goal setting has certainly improved as far as being a fair judge of how long things are going to take. I am no longer overestimating my ability to get things done that I have not looked at or interfaced with before. Another thing that went well was that I managed to get a good foundational layout for my bucket 1 Project setup before the end of the day. As for something that didn't go so well, I feel like the meetup wasn't so great in the beginning during the meet and greet stage. Im trying to get over my social awkwardness in large groups, but its still a difficult thing for me to manage. From here forward, I plan to get a good grasp of what I plan on doing before I start making goals that are too far out of reach.</p>
