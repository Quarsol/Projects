        <p class="content">To start, one thing not included in the recording is me muting my notifications, as I did that before the recording started (you can see the icon greyed out). As for how things went, I feel like they went pretty well. Better than I expected in all honesty. Still taking some time to wrap my head around all of this at such a fast pace, but I am getting there. Clearing the notifications and shutting down unused programs tended to help me a lot when it comes to being focused. I may try listening to music next time, as that seems to be helpful for others. Not sure if it will be for me, but it might due to getting rid of distractions outside of the computer (i.e. Traffic noises, breakout talks, and other people typing on their keyboards). <br> <br> With the basics I had from the first drill, as well as a fresh review of flexbox froggy, I set out to mess around a little more freely than I have in the past. I tried out a couple of different options when it came to formatting the layout with CSS, but stuck to the more tried and true methods I have learned in drills and with flexbox froggy. Some of the google searches for CSS brought out some really weird commands, and since I could not figure out why it worked, I decided to go with things that I know the reason for them working. <br> <br> I'm hoping that when it comes to drill 3, I can finish it even faster than I did drill 2. I'm looking forward to giving it a shot and seeing where things go. <br> <br> (P.S. I know it seems disjointed and a little incoherent, but I have never been very good at writing blog style things about myself. I prefer to keep things focused on a story or subject. Always been uncomfortable talking about myself whether verbally or through text. Something I am working on for the future.)</p>

        <p class="content">I went ahead and continued my task of completing the 3rd drill of building multipage websites. I went ahead and shut out my notifications and closed all excess windows, only kepping atom, the website itself, the example page, and one final tab for google searches. I fully closed out of slack, and muted and put my phone in my backpack to help decrease the possible number of distractions I would come accross. It did seem to help a bit. <br> <br> I played around a bit with the code, liberally using the command Z function when I broke something. I made sure any changes I made were small, and checked them to see what they did, especially with CSS and flexbox. Its still difficult to wrap my head around a bit, but I am getting a much better handle on it as time goes on. I did not try music like I had intended as per my last post, just because I wanted to sit down and get things done. I did allow myself opportunities to break and take a brief walk in order to get my head out of the code and give myself some perspective.</p>

        <h3>26 February, 2018</h3>
        <p class="content">Today I am working on Firebase and JavaScript drills. I went ahead and cleared the stage as before, muting notifications and shutting down slack and the like. Put on some music to start with, found it too distracting, and shut it off within about 5 minutes. I guess music doesnt help me like it does others. Maybe if I found something without lyrics. I tend to concentrate too much on them. Firebase.... was extremely straightforward and simple. I was done within 5 minutes and was a little bewildered by it. JavaScript is another matter entirely. I am attempting to work my way through, looking up syntax as I come across things I do not understand. Kim was kind enough to Slack me a video of when she went over most of the first drill with a previous class, which was helpful in some ways. <br> <br> Like I stated previously, the music was not helpful at the start. I may try again with something that doesn't have lyrics, though I am unsure if that will be helpful or not. The fact of how quickly I was able to get through Firebase drills may have made me a little overconfident in my skills when it came to JavaScript. From what I have heard from others, Firebase seems to be one of those one off things that everyone seems to click with almost immediately. I am hoping to improve my understanding of JavaScript and finish these drills by end of day tomorrow, the 27th, but we will see how well that goes.</p>
