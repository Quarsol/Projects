       <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p class="content">What to say about myself. Well, I am a former member of the US Army, I love geek and nerd culture
          such as video games and table top games, and I have a fondness for coding. I first got a taste of it
          a few years back when I watched a Youtuber participate in Ludum Dare 48 hour game making jam. I was heavily
          intrigued by his use of Unity to make a game from just his thoughts. From there, I began watching some of his
          content on programming in general. I found it highly facscinating. I didn't think to pursue it much at the
          time as I was focused on other things in regards to my work life. I slowly began to think more and more that
          I needed a change of pace. I needed some form of work that I actually enjoyed and didn't slog through for 8
          hours just for a paycheck. It was at that point I heard about Galvanize and decided to give it a shot. From
          here, we will look at some of the things that I have learned and continue to strive for while attending this
          program. Just follow the links about to move to some of the other pages I have created.</p>
