        <h3>Denver Script, 27 February, 2018. 6pm to 9pm.</h3>
        <p class="content"><b>People I Met:</b><br><br>Stephen - Full Stack (but mostly Front-End) Developer at machineshop.io<br><br>Shannon B - Full Stack Developer @ Cake (Work w/ Pinnacle Insurance)<br><br><b>What I Learned:</b><br><br>Very long and involved talk about how useful Docker has become over Vagrant for virtual machines, specifically the strain on memory usage. I found it quite interesting, though several bits of terminology, and the technology itself, went a little over my head. There also was a talk from the perspective of someone who has worked in tech for quite some time, and the experiences they have gone through in regards to various jobs. Their presentation was a kind of "pick your own adventure" game type deal, which definitely helped with keeping attention for the audience as well as getting them more involved. Overall, a very interesting talk from both presenters. Also, interesting side note, when on Github, if you press 'T' on the keyboard you can search all of your Github files.<br><br><b>Questions I Have:</b><br><br>1. Im a little lost when it comes to the actual use of Docker as a whole, though I guess we will be going over that at some point in the curriculum according to other students.<br>2. What is the reason that Vagrant is so intensive on memory and how does Docker get around that?<br>3. How realistic is it that the second speaker went through so much crap in her career? Will I go through anything like that?</p>
